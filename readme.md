# Hand Writtern Character Recognition

Handwritten Character Recognition (HWCR), is the ability of a computer to receive and interpret
handwritten characters, input from sources such as paper documents, photographs, touch-screens 
and other devices.

The current iteration of the project has aimed on:
1. HWCR Using Logistic Regression algorithm and MNIST Dataset
2. HWCR Using Neural Network along with MNIST Dataset as well as Real World Test Images
3. HWCR Using Logistic Regression with The Real World Test Images
4. Mathematical Operators Using Logistic Regression and Training and Testing with Real World Dataset
5. Dicussed and Implemented how an image is transformed into a vector to perform the mathematical operations


Some of the major applications are:
- License Number of Vehicles captutred in CCTV cameras
- Amount in Bank Cheque books to automate the process
- Quick digitiation of documents
- Post Office Automation

Tasks to be accomplished in near future:
1. Multiple Character recognition in a single image.
2. Detection of digits greater than 9.
3. Performing Mathematical Calculations(Given the equation predict the result).
4. Discussing about the efficiency of all the algorithms.
